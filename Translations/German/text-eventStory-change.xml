These reports say that far to the north, beyond even the barbarous Celtic and Germanic link(CONCEPT_TRIBE,2), is a land of perpetual snow where the sun shines at midnight in the summer, and the winter is an unending darkness broken only by Aurora's chariot racing across the sky. They say that great giants roam there, and live for a thousand years.

Could {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} have reached the legendary realm of Hyperborea?</de-DE>

		<de-DE>All {CITY-2} is enraptured with tales of {CHARACTER-SHORT-0}'s exploits in India, land of the ant's gold! These reports say that far to the east, beyond even the tallest mountains, is a land of scorching deserts and unending sun where the sandy wastes are interrupted only by mounds of golden earth.

Rumor is that giant ants, larger than foxes, live in that desert. They dig up the ground to build their homes, much as they do here, and in so doing bring gold to the surface. The men then come when the sun is hottest and the ants are underground to haul the gold away with teams of yoked camels, fleeing with great haste lest they be caught by the jealous ants. 

Should {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} continue {G0:his:her} travels in lands of such danger and opportunity?</de-DE>

		<de-DE>{CHARACTER-0} scoured the desert wastes for the legendary ant's gold but found nothing other than sand, misery, and normal sized ants. There were camels though. So, {G0:he:she} abandoned the avaricious quest for gold and continued on into the far eastern realm of Hindush, where {G0:he:she} discovered riches of a different sort.

{CHARACTER-SHORT-0} has now taken up residence in the court of a noble Indian prince and reports that the broad rivers and dense jungles of that land house a proud and learned people. {G0:He:She} would like to stay in India a little while longer, absorbing the knowledge and spiritual beliefs of such an exotic realm, and its enigmatic pujaris, before returning home to regale all {CITY-2} with {G0:his:her} learning. 

Will you permit {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} to stay at an Indian court before returning home, or shall {G0:he:she} continue exploring?</de-DE>

{CHARACTER-SHORT-0}'s party returned to the shore and stopped in a small fishing village of an unknown nation. {G0:He:She} has befriended some of the locals there and asks to return to {CITY-2} with a link(SPECIALIST_FISHER) in tow, or {G0:he:she} can continue {G0:his:her} travels.</de-DE>

Their party spotted some shy native tribes that tend to flee from their presence, but none of them are giants. {CHARACTER-0} has managed to trade some gold and trinkets with the locals for furs, the quality and size of which is allegedly most impressive.

		<de-DE>{CHARACTER-0} has been living among the Druids for some time and has adopted their dress and customs. Fortunately, the disturbing rumors of human sacrifice and orgies are largely fabricated, and {CHARACTER-0} has not participated in, or even seen, such rituals {G0:himself:herself}. {G0:He:She} has instead been occupied with the study of the many herbal and philosophical arts of the Druids, including the brewing of healing salves, and the Druidic belief in the immortality of the soul. 

{CHARACTER-SHORT-0} has become quite attached to {G0:his:her} Druidic hosts and would like to stay among them for some time before returning home. However, should {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} stay much longer among these people, there is concern that {G0:he:she} may acquire not only an aura of the exotic back in {PLAYER-2}, but that {G0:he:she} may even descend into unbridled madness or barbarous cruelty.

{CHARACTER-SHORT-0} reports that in the depths of the ocean lurk horrors beyond imagining. {G0:He:She} tells tales of immense tentacled beasts that can crush a ship with a dozen sinewy arms and ravenous behemoths that consist of naught but a gaping maw of a thousand razor sharp teeth, with which they swallow men whole. 

{CHARACTER-SHORT-0} has grown wary of these dangers and desires to return home to the safety of {CITY-2}, well beyond the reach of such nightmarish creatures of the sea.</de-DE>

The {PLAYER-1,1} people are concerned that {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} has been gone for too long and will soon permanently grow beyond the influence of {G0:his:her} native land. {G0:His:Her} liaisons with these foreigners have become the stuff of legend!

Some bold rumormongers claim that {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} attends Pagan rituals, including orgies and even ritualistic human sacrifices. One messenger has reported that Druidic priests at these rituals pack innocents into a towering wicker man and then set the effigy alight! Such heresies are typical for barbarians, but that {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} should participate in them is simply beyond imagining.

Should {CHARACTER-SHORT-0} be permitted to continue living among the Druids of the forest?</de-DE>

Die große Statue des Helios wurde nach dem glücklichen Ausgang der Belagerung von Rhodos (305–304 v. Chr.) errichtet, die im Rahmen der Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den Nachfolgern Alexanders des Großen stattgefunden hatte.<br>
Aus historischer Sicht wäre der Sieg der Rhodier gegen den mächtigen Gegner Demetrios I. Poliorketes ohne die Unterstützung durch den griechischen Beherrscher von Ägypten, Ptolemaios I. Soter, kaum zustande gekommen.<br>
Die Rhodier selbst sahen das anders. Sie errichteten mehrere Monumente in der Stadt, die das Ereignis für die Nachwelt festhielten und feierten.]]>

		<de-DE><![CDATA[Das Museion von Alexandria, welches die berühmte Bibliothek von Alexandria inbegriff, entstand Anfang des 3. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. in der kurz zuvor in Ägypten gegründeten makedonisch-griechischen Stadt Alexandria.<br>
Im Museion wirkten zahlreiche berühmte Gelehrte und es bildete sich die Alexandrinische Schule heraus. Wahrscheinlich war die wesentliche Funktion der Bibliothek die einer Schul- und Forschungsbibliothek des Museions.<br>
Die Bibliothek verfügte über einen für die damaligen Verhältnisse enormen, aber heute unbekannten Bestand an Schriftrollen. Es handelte sich dabei sowohl um literarische Schriften als auch große Mengen an wissenschaftlicher Literatur aus den verschiedensten Fachgebieten.<br>.]]>

		<de-DE><![CDATA[Der Circus Maximus war der größte Circus im antiken Rom. Er hatte eine Gesamtlänge von 600 Metern sowie eine Breite von 140 Metern. Sein Fassungsvermögen soll laut Dionysios von Halikarnassos im Ausbaustand zur Zeit des Augustus 150.000 Plätze, zur Zeit des älteren Plinius 250.000 Plätze betragen haben. Er wurde bis ins 6. Jahrhundert für Wagenrennen genutzt.<br>
Erst Gaius Iulius Caesar, der den Circus in seiner Breite erweiterte, ließ anlässlich seiner Triumphalspiele im Jahr 46 v. Chr. zum Teil dauerhafte Sitzstufen aus Marmor einbauen und umgab die Arena mit einem Wassergraben, um sie vom Zuschauerraum zu trennen.<br>
Der Circus diente in der Kaiserzeit nicht zuletzt der Kommunikation der Herrscher mit der Stadtbevölkerung, deren Akklamationen man hier entgegennahm.]]>

		<de-DE><![CDATA[The Pantheon is a former Roman temple, now a Catholic church, in Rome, Italy, on the site of an earlier temple commissioned by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD).<br>
It was completed by the emperor Hadrian and probably dedicated about 126 AD. Its date of construction is uncertain, because Hadrian chose not to inscribe the new temple but rather to retain the inscription of Agrippa's older temple, which had burned down.<br>
Almost two thousand years after it was built, the Pantheon's dome is still the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same, 43 metres (142 ft).<br>
It is one of the best-preserved of all Ancient Roman buildings, in large part because it has been in continuous use throughout its history.]]>

Nach dem Niederbrennen zweier Vorläuferbauten verfolgte Kaiser Justinian mit dem Bau einer Kuppelbasilika im 6. Jahrhundert n. Chr. ein besonders ambitioniertes baupolitisches Programm. Sie ist dabei nicht nur die letzte der spätantiken Großkirchen, die seit Konstantin dem Großen im Römischen Reich errichtet wurden, sondern gilt in ihrer architektonischen Einzigartigkeit oft als eine Kirche ohne Vorbilder und ohne Nachahmung<br>
Die Kuppel der Hagia Sophia bleibt mit ursprünglich 33 Metern Spannweite bis zum heutigen Tage die größte über nur vier Tragepunkten errichtete Ziegel-Kuppel der Architekturgeschichte und gilt mit der gigantischen Umsetzung und ihrer besonderen Harmonie und Proportionen als eines der bedeutendsten Gebäude aller Zeiten.]]>

Wegen der günstigen Lage an der Kreuzung wichtiger Handelswege ist die Altstadt von Damaskus einer der ältesten kontinuierlich bewohnten Orte weltweit. Die Umayyaden machten Damaskus zur Hauptstadt ihres Kalifats.
Außer den mittelalterlichen Bauten, die von dieser Blütezeit zeugen, sind im Stadtbild auch Elemente hellenistischer, römischer und byzantinischer Architektur erkennbar. Insgesamt präsentiert sich die historische Altstadt dem Besucher heute in der Form, die sie seit der ottomanischen Eroberung am Anfang des 16. Jahrhunderts erhielt.]]>

{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_EGYPT:The locals call the game senet - the game of passing. A board is set up with three rows of ten squares each, on which each player sets five pieces. Twigs are thrown to determine how the pieces may move. The game's objective is to get your pieces off the board first by moving them to the end of the board. Senet players are well advised to keep away from the House of Water, or else they have to restart at the House of Rebirth!:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ROME:The game's name is ludus latrunculorum, or latrones for short - the game of brigands. The players agree on a number of pieces, such as 16 or 24, to place on an 8x8 board. They place their pieces on the board on alternate turns, finally placing the Dux - a leader piece. Once all the pieces are in place, the players move their pieces so as to catch opposing pieces between two of their own, thus capturing the enemy piece. Latrones has gained particular appreciation among young men and women looking to hone their skills as tacticians.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_BABYLONIA:It's a two player game called the Game of Twenty Squares. The game is played on a board where two large rectangular areas are joined by a narrow "bridge". Both players have seven pieces, gradually placed on the board , and throw a four-sided die to determine the allowed moves. Players race to remove their own pieces by getting them to the other end of the board while trying to capture opposing pieces to impede their opponent's progress.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ASSYRIA:Nobody seems to know for sure whether the game is a local invention or was brought by traders from abroad. Whatever the case may be, it goes by "game of fifty eight holes", derived from the setup of the game board, which has two sets of twenty nine holes. One player has five sticks with dog heads while the other has five with jackal heads. The objective of the game is to gradually move your sticks past the opponent's to a point at the end of the board.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_PERSIA:The game is known as nardashir, or nard for short. Each player has multiple ivory pieces, which are moved between triangles on the game board, with a throw of two dice determining the possible moves. Lone pieces may be captured by the opponent, while triangles with two or more pieces are invulnerable. Players race to the opposite end of the board while also attacking each other's pieces. In addition to being a tense game itself, nard has also attracted attention from gamblers.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_CARTHAGE:Rumor has it, the game is a variant of another game played in far-off lands, though nobody knows for sure. Whatever the origin, the game is remarkably simple, needing nothing more than a series of holes and some seeds or stones to be played. Players place their seeds in pits, as if sowing. On each turn, the players rearrange their seeds across other pits, trying to capture some of the opponent's seeds in the process. The winner of this game can claim to be a more accomplished planner and landowner.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_GREECE:The people call this game petteia, and have come to consider it a test of wits and strategy. Two players face off on a rectangular board, one controls white pieces and the other one black. Players attempt to surround the opponent's pieces to capture them, and ultimately to leave their opponent with no moves to make. Petteia players say that a struggle in this game is just like watching opposing phalanxes face off on a battlefield.:}
