		<Translation><![CDATA[Das Ischtar-Tor – eines der Stadttore von Babylon – sowie die Prozessionsstraße wurden in ihrer endgültigen Form unter der Herrschaft von Nebukadnezar II. (605–562 v. Chr.) errichtet.<br>
Das Ischtar-Tor war zur Zeit Nebukadnezars II. das nördliche Stadttor in den inneren Mauerringen des Ostteils der Stadt. Obwohl es insgesamt fünf Tore gab zeichnete sich das Ischtar-Tor durch seine besonders prachtvolle Ausstattung vor den anderen Toren aus.<br>
Der Torbau ist doppeltorig, das bedeutet, dass er aus zwei Bauten besteht, einem etwas kleineren Nordtor, welches man zuerst durchschritt und einem großen Südtor, hinter welchem sich ein großer Platz öffnete, der schließlich zur Prozessionsstraße führte.]]>

Jahrhundert mit etwa 115 bis 160 Metern der höchste Leuchtturm, der je gebaut wurde. Nach der kleinen Insel Pharos, bei der er stand, wird er seit der Antike auch Pharos von Alexandria genannt. Der Leuchtturm von Alexandria war das jüngste der sieben Weltwunder der Antike.<br>
Der Turm wurde von Sostratos von Knidos von etwa 299 bis 279 v. Chr. im Auftrag von Ptolemaios I. erbaut, der 800 Talente (21.000 kg) Silber bereitstellte. Der Bau wurde erst unter der Herrschaft von Ptolemaios II. fertiggestellt.<br>

Sie kann mit ihren hunderten Reliefs als eines der antiken Weltwunder gelten und diente als Empfangs- bzw. Audienzsaal der Herrscher. Das ist unter anderem aus Details der Reliefs der Apadana-Stiegenaufgänge zu ersehen, auf denen die Könige und ihre Untertanen dargestellt sind.<br>
Der Apadana hatte bei seiner Erbauung vor 2500 Jahren einen gedeckten Innenraum von 3600 m² und 36 reichverzierte, 20 m hohe Säulen, von denen bei der Zerstörung 330 v. Chr. durch die Armee Alexander des Großen nur wenige Reste stehenblieben.<br>
Bis zur teilweisen Restaurierung im 20. Jahrhundert war lediglich eine Säule erhalten. Die anderen wurden zum Bau umliegender Ortschaften verwendet.]]>

Das Mausoleum gehörte zu den „Sieben Weltwundern der Antike“. Es wurde von zwei griechischen Architekten und vier griechischen Bildhauern gebaut.<br>
Seit Antipatros von Sidon gehört es wegen der Schönheit, des überwältigenden Gesamteindruckes und der kostbaren Statuen und Relieffriese zum klassischen Kanon der Sieben Weltwunder und wurde erst im 16. Jahrhundert bis auf die Fundamente nahezu vollständig abgetragen.]]>

Den ältesten Teil der Stadt Athen ließ Perikles nach der Zerstörung durch die Perser unter Leitung des berühmten Bildhauers Phidias von den Architekten Iktinos und Kallikrates sowie Mnesikles neu bebauen.<br>
Nach dem Sieg über die Perser wurde Athen als Vormacht des Attischen Seebundes ab 448 v. Chr. unter Perikles zum Zentrum der hellenischen Welt. Diese Macht und den damit verbundenen Reichtum wollte man auch durch Bauwerke demonstrieren, zumal die Perser bei ihrer Einnahme der Stadt 480 v.

Chr. nach zwölfjähriger Bauzeit vollendet und in der Inselhauptstadt Rhodos aufgestellt wurde. Die Kolossalstatue stürzte etwa 227/226 v. Chr. infolge eines Erdbebens um. Sie zählte bereits in der Antike zu den sieben Weltwundern.<br>
Die große Statue des Helios wurde nach dem glücklichen Ausgang der Belagerung von Rhodos (305–304 v. Chr.) errichtet, die im Rahmen der Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den Nachfolgern Alexanders des Großen stattgefunden hatte.<br>
Aus historischer Sicht wäre der Sieg der Rhodier gegen den mächtigen Gegner Demetrios I. Poliorketes ohne die Unterstützung durch den griechischen Beherrscher von Ägypten, Ptolemaios I. Soter, kaum zustande gekommen.<br>
Die Rhodier selbst sahen das anders. Sie errichteten mehrere Monumente in der Stadt, die das Ereignis für die Nachwelt festhielten und feierten.]]>

Jahrhundert für Wagenrennen genutzt.<br>
Erst Gaius Iulius Caesar, der den Circus in seiner Breite erweiterte, ließ anlässlich seiner Triumphalspiele im Jahr 46 v. Chr. zum Teil dauerhafte Sitzstufen aus Marmor einbauen und umgab die Arena mit einem Wassergraben, um sie vom Zuschauerraum zu trennen.<br>

Nach dem Niederbrennen zweier Vorläuferbauten verfolgte Kaiser Justinian mit dem Bau einer Kuppelbasilika im 6. Jahrhundert n. Chr. ein besonders ambitioniertes baupolitisches Programm. Sie ist dabei nicht nur die letzte der spätantiken Großkirchen, die seit Konstantin dem Großen im Römischen Reich errichtet wurden, sondern gilt in ihrer architektonischen Einzigartigkeit oft als eine Kirche ohne Vorbilder und ohne Nachahmung<br>
Die Kuppel der Hagia Sophia bleibt mit ursprünglich 33 Metern Spannweite bis zum heutigen Tage die größte über nur vier Tragepunkten errichtete Ziegel-Kuppel der Architekturgeschichte und gilt mit der gigantischen Umsetzung und ihrer besonderen Harmonie und Proportionen als eines der bedeutendsten Gebäude aller Zeiten.]]>
